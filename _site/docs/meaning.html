<p><em>By Marion Walton, University of Cape Town</em></p>

<p>All media are used to communicate <strong>meaning</strong>. Since the earliest days of humanity’s evolution (between 100 000 and 30 000 years ago) humans have been developing symbolic communication by using the media at hand, such as spoken language and ochre paint (<a href="/ideas/references/index.html#hodgskiss_2015">Hodgskiss, 2015</a>).</p>

<h3 id="semiotic-resources">Semiotic resources</h3>

<p>Whenever we create or interpret some form of media, we are using <a href="https://media-and-society.glitch.me/ideas/definitions/#semiotic_resources"><strong>semiotic resources</strong></a>.</p>

<p>Everyday media rely on <strong>physical means</strong> such as your own body (e.g. your hairstyle) or clothing and <strong>abilities</strong>, such as the ability to speak, hear or see, and <strong>cultural knowledge</strong> such as the ability to speak one or many languages and the knowledge of other social conventions such as visual codes about which hairstyles, clothing and gestures to use in different places such as home, school or the workplace.</p>

Why do you think they chose to use these particular resources? (You can submit your answer using the form at the bottom of the page.)</p>

<p>The meanings of the messages we produce every day are conveyed with <a href="https://media-and-society.glitch.me/ideas/definitions/#sign">signs</a>. By “sign”, we mean, broadly, something which stands for something else – we will explore this in more detail later in the course.</p>

<h3 id="semiosis-and-meaning-making">Semiosis and meaning-making</h3>

<p>We seldom work with individual signs; instead we use combinations of physical resources and cultural knowledge, which we call <a href="https://media-and-society.glitch.me/ideas/definitions/#semiotic_resources">semiotic resources</a>. (The word “semiotic” comes from <strong>semiosis</strong>, which in turn derives from the Greek word <em>sēma</em>, or “sign” (<a href="https://media-and-society.glitch.me/ideas/definitions/#harper_nd">Harper, n.d.</a>)). Semiosis refers to how we use <strong>signs</strong> in <strong>meaning-making</strong> activities (Kress, 2010; Van Leeuwen, 2004), or, in other words, the processes by which we produce and interpret messages.</p>

<p>As Van Leeuwen (2004:285) points out, we make meanings based on how we have seen semiotic resources being used in the past.</p>

<p>In the case of visual modes, for example, we might often encounter certain hairstyles and gestures in specific social settings, such as schools or protests respectively. As a result, we come to associate these situational meanings with particular hairstyles and gestures.</p>

<p>In the case of verbal languages, a language such as English has a long history and includes many stereotypical terms which have historically been used to express derogatory judgements about women in past eras and today (<a href="/ideas/references/index.html#mills_2008">Mills, 2008</a>). Thus we often internalise these sexist and other discriminatory judgements in the process of learning a language and getting to know the world around us.</p>

<p>The potential for a language to influence our thinking is so profound that philosophers have highlighted that we are only able to speak by virtue of our language “putting the words in our mouth”. As Gadamer pointed out, “it is literally more correct to say that language speaks <em>us</em>, rather than that <em>we</em> speak it” (<a href="/ideas/references/index.html#gadamer_1982">Gadamer, 1982:463</a>), or in Heidegger’s words, “Language speaks.” (<a href="/ideas/references/index.html#heidegger_1971">1971:124</a>).</p>

<p>We can also use semiotic resources to create new, changed meanings, because it is possible to use them in new contexts. For example, the photograph in Figure 1 depicts Zulaikha Patel wearing a school uniform, an Afro hairstyle, and raising her fist. This is why <a href="/ideas/references/index.html#van_leeuwen_2004">Van Leeuwen, 2004</a> argues that the possible meanings of a semiotic resource are a kind of <strong>affordance</strong>, which has both potentialities and constraints:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Semiotic resources have a meaning potential, based on their past uses, and a set of affordances based on their possible uses” (Van Leeuwen, 2004:285).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whether we create a message or receive it, every time we interpret a particular semiotic resource we are <strong>making meanings</strong>. In this way, meanings work differently to actual codes. Codes (such as Morse code or computer code) are specialized systems which allow us to decode a message exactly, once we know how it was encoded. By contrast, people always notice, attend to, select, frame and interpret semiotic resources in a particular context. As <a href="/ideas/references/index.html#hall_2006">Hall, 2006</a> points out, this means we often “read” media differently from one another.</p>

<p>We will take these discussions further in our study of <strong>Semiotics</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="languages">Languages</h3>

<p>English plays a disproportionately influential role in world media. As a result of the colonial dominance of the British Empire, and the subsequent rise to power of the USA, global news flows have been English-dominated and global media have often promoted Anglo-American popular and digital cultures, as we explore in our discussion of media and <a href="/ideas/2_power/">power</a>.</p>

<p>At least 35 languages are spoken in South Africa, including official, unofficial and marginalised languages. African languages carry a rich heritage of <strong>oramedia</strong> or traditional oral forms and indigenous media such as storytelling, proverbs, folklore, folktales, drama, puppetry and oral poetry.</p>

<p>These oramedia play a crucial role <strong>sharing ideas and values</strong> in African contexts (<a href="/ideas/references/index.html#ugboajah_1985">Ugboajah, 1985</a>; <a href="/ideas/references/index.html#ugboajah_1987">Ugboajah, 1987</a>; <a href="/ideas/references/index.html#willems_2014">Willems, 2014</a>). Digital media now means it’s possible to further extend the reach of these traditional oral forms (<a href="/ideas/references/index.html#nkoala_2023">Nkoala, 2023</a>).</p>

<h3 id="visual-modes">Visual modes</h3>

<p>Meaning is also conveyed visually through the language of visual design (<a href="/ideas/references/index.html#kress_van_leeuwen_2006">Kress &amp; Van Leeuwen, 2006</a>; <a href="/ideas/references/index.html#jewitt_oyama_2001">Jewitt &amp; Oyama, 2001</a>), software interfaces, the photographic codes used in print media or websites as well as the cinematic codes in video. We also make meaning through gestures, whether using South African sign language or imitating dance moves on TikTok. An important part of learning about media involves learning the skills to both <strong>interpret and produce</strong> a range of visual modes of communication.</p>

<p>Socially shared <strong>semiotic systems</strong> can thus include written and spoken languages, music, visual conventions such as expressive typefaces, emoji or memes, and photographic and video codes.</p>
