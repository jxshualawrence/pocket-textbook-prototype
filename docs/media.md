## Thinking about media

*By Marion Walton, University of Cape Town*

What did you do when you first opened your eyes this morning? What did you do yesterday evening?

There’s a good chance that your morning and evening rituals involved paying attention to some type of media. Perhaps in the morning you checked your [social media](https://media-and-society.glitch.me/ideas/social-media/) timelines for updates from friends on Instagram or new trends on TikTok, or you checked your browser for the news. Perhaps in the evening you settled down to watch a form of [mass media](https://media-and-society.glitch.me/ideas/mass-media/), such as a television series on a streaming platform. If you’re like most South Africans, the sound of a radio or podcast kept you company at some time in the day.

It’s very likely that you used a medium to communicate with others — aural (speech, singing) or visual (clothing, facial expressions, gestures, sign language).

> **Activity:**  
> Because we use so many forms of media without even noticing, reflect on:  
> - When do you first remember using media?  
> - What role have different languages and media played in your life so far?  
> - Which media industries do you find most interesting?

### What are media?

In English, the word *media* evolved from the Latin *medius* (“in the middle”) ([Harper, n.d.](https://www.etymonline.com/word/media)). In this course we study the physical media, languages, and industries we use to connect and communicate.

We tend to think of print or electronic media, but people have been communicating via media for millennia. For example, the [“Iziko Rhino”](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Kinderdam_rhino.jpg) (see Figure 1) is a rock engraving made by Later Stone Age ancestors of the ǀXam San at Kinderdam, North West Province, between 1 000 and 10 000 years ago.

That engraving’s **affordances** — its durability, interaction with surrounding light, even flickering firelight that animates the lines — still connect us to its creators (Hodgskiss & Esterhuysen, 2019). We call these **affordances** the potentials and constraints of a medium ([definitions](https://media-and-society.glitch.me/ideas/definitions/#Affordance)).

Many other communication technologies followed: print, digital images, audio/video formats, radio waves, the internet and generative AI.

### Oramedia

[Oramedia](https://media-and-society.glitch.me/ideas/oramedia/) includes oral storytelling, proverbs, folktales, drama, puppetry and poetry (Ugboajah, 1985). These often use performance, improvisation, mimicry, music, dance, tonal language features and audience interaction (Finnegan, 2012:5–10).

### What about digital media?

Today’s digital media rely on electricity, internet connections, fibre-optics, broadcast signals and complex production/distribution systems — enabling global communication at the click of a button.

In the case of the Iziko Rhino, a Wikipedian at the Africa Centre in Cape Town published a photograph of the engraving to [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org), making it viewable worldwide.

### What makes social media different?

Social media platforms unite users, creators and advertisers on single apps or sites, providing tools for sharing text, photos and video with friends, family, or for entertainment and professional purposes.

> **Activity:**  
> Compare posting via (1) email vs. (2) a social media platform.  
> - Which affordances do you appreciate most?  
> - Which do you dislike?

### Is AI a form of media?

Generative AI systems automate media creation via statistical models: LLMs (e.g. ChatGPT) for text, diffusion models (e.g. DALL·E) for images.  

<em>Synthetic Rhino by DALL·E</em>  
![Synthetic Iziko Rhino by DALL·E]({{ '/assets/img/DALL-E_iziko_rhino.webp' | relative_url }})

This **synthetic media** raises questions of trust, bias and provenance — capable of bulk misinformation or “deepfakes.”

## Meanings of “media”

1. **Media of production/distribution/reception**: print, sound waves, rock engravings, fabrics, paint.  
2. **Medium (mode) of communication**: human languages (isiXhosa, Afrikaans, English), visuals, music.  
3. **Media industries**: for-profit broadcasters, publishers, PR agencies, social platforms — motivated by ad revenue and subscriptions.

Though the Iziko Rhino lives on a non-profit Wikimedia Commons, we still rely on commercial industries (devices, hosting, electricity, internet) to access it.
