## Thinking about media

*By Marion Walton, University of Cape Town*

What did you do when you first opened your eyes this morning? What did you do yesterday evening?

There’s a good chance that your morning and evening rituals involved paying attention to some type of media. Perhaps in the morning you checked your [social media]({{ site.baseurl }}/ideas/social-media/) timelines for updates from friends on Instagram or to see new trends on TikTok, or checked your browser for the news. Perhaps in the evening you settled down to watch a form of [mass media]({{ site.baseurl }}/ideas/mass-media/), such as a television series on a broadcast or streaming platform. Probably, if you’re like most South Africans, the sound of a radio or podcast kept you company at some time in the day.

It’s very likely that you used a medium to communicate with others, perhaps an aural medium such as the sound produced when you speak (or sing in the shower!) or a visual medium such as your clothing, facial expressions, gestures or sign language.

### What are media?

In English, the word *media* evolved from the Latin *medius* which means “in the middle” ([Harper, n.d.](https://www.etymonline.com/word/media)). In this course we are studying media of communication, the physical media, languages and industries which we use to connect with others and to communicate.

We tend to think of media as print or electronic media, but people have been using media to communicate for a very long time. For example, rock engravings like the “Iziko Rhino” :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3} were created thousands of years ago and have survived to connect us with their original makers. The enduring nature of a rock engraving is one of its *affordances* for communication; at different times of day or in certain light, the engravings may even appear to move (e.g. flickering in firelight).

Many other communication technologies have since been developed, including print media, digital images, audio and video formats, the electromagnetic spectrum (e.g. radio waves, cellphone signals), the internet, and generative AI.

### Oramedia

[Oramedia]({{ site.baseurl }}/ideas/oramedia/) includes traditionally oral forms such as storytelling, proverbs, folklore, folktales, drama, puppetry and oral poetry (Ugbuojah, 1985), many of which are only produced using the human body.

These forms often go beyond the spoken word, using vivid performances, improvisation, mimicry, music, dance, the tonal character of many African languages, and the responses of the audience to make the most of the potential affordances of the oral medium (Finnegan, 2012:5–10).

### What about digital media?

Today many forms of digital media are encoded in different formats and depend on a specific configuration of technologies and infrastructure such as electricity, internet connectivity, fibre optic cables, electromagnetic signals transmitted by radio or television broadcasters or mobile phone signals. Contemporary technologies of production and distribution mean that it is possible to communicate across long distances with people around the world.

### What makes social media different?

Social media platforms bring together users, content creators and advertisers, typically on a dedicated site or app. Most platforms provide tools for sharing media (text, photos, videos) with family and friends or for entertainment and professional networking.

### Is AI a form of media?

Generative Artificial Intelligence or [Generative AI]({{ site.baseurl }}/ideas/synthetic-media/) systems automate media production by computers. We call this *synthetic media*. Generative AI uses statistical models—like Large Language Models (e.g. ChatGPT) for text or diffusion models (e.g. DALL·E) for images—to synthesize new content.

Here’s a quick demo YouTube embed (replace `VIDEO_ID` with an actual demo clip):

{% include youtube.html id="VIDEO_ID" %}

Synthetic media raises issues of trust, bias, and provenance—bulk‐generated “AI sludge” can flood social feeds with dis- or misinformation and deepfakes.

## Meanings of “media”

When we talk loosely about media, we tend to bundle several senses of the word together:

1. **Media of production, distribution and reception**  
   Durable materials (rock, print) or digital formats (audio, video) used to create & convey messages.

2. **Medium (mode) of communication**  
   Human languages (isiXhosa, Afrikaans, English) or other modes (visuals, music).

3. **Media industries & organisations**  
   For-profit networks like broadcasters, publishers, and social platforms that package & sell media.
